# The Challenge and its Proposed Solution


# Main Class: ReadTextFile.java

The above class contains the main function and includes calls to various components of the program. 
The various components of the program include:

Input Preprocessor: includes files -> PreProcessor.java, Campaign.java, Contribution.java

Processor: includes files-> CampaignByZip.java, CampaignByDate.java, CampaignValue.java, RunningMedianProcessor.java,             RunningMedianCalculator.java   

Output Processor: includes files->AppendToFileExample.java, WriteDate.java

# PreProcessor Design 
Considerations
Discards Null values and takes care of garbage values from input file.


Output: Clean variables for CMTE ID, ZIP,DATE,AMOUNT
